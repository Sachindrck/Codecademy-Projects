## Usage Funnels with Warby Parker
[Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/) is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world. For every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

In this project, we will analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates.

## Page Visits Funnel
Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked us to analyze data on visits to their website. Our job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
3. A user clicks “checkout”
4. A user actually purchases a t-shirt

#### Result :star2:

## Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz
“A thousand years or more ago,
When I was newly sewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known.”
The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry welcomes you! First-year students must go through the annual Sorting Ceremony.

The Sorting Hat is a talking hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to:
1. gryffindor
2. hufflepuff
3. ravenclaw
4. slytherin


## Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
You may have played Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have you played Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock? This is the infamous game brought to popularity with the TV show The Big Bang Theory.
#### Note from the creator, Sam Kass:
“I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability. This version is also nice because it satisfies the Law of Fives.”
