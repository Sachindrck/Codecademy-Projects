## Usage Funnels with Warby Parker
[Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/) is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world. For every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

In this project, we will analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates.

## User Churn with Codeflix
Codeflix, a streaming video startup, is interested in measuring their user churn rate. In this project, we’ll be helping them answer these questions about their churn:

  -How many months has the company been operating? Which months do you have enough information to calculate a churn rate?
What segments of users exist? <br>

2. What is the overall churn trend since the company started?

3. Compare the churn rates between user segments.
  -Which segment of users should the company focus on expanding?

## Page Visits Funnel
Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked us to analyze data on visits to their website. Our job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:
1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
3. A user clicks “checkout”
4. A user actually purchases a t-shirt
